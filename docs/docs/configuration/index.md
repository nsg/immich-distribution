# About configuration

By default you should have a working installation of Immich, but you may like to configure it a bit.

!!! Note
    Note that Immich focuses on easy of install, not to be fully configurable so everyting from upstream Immich is not configurable. But feel free to open an issue if you like to have an option added.

:material-chat-alert-outline: The configuration options are organized in separate sub pages under this section.
