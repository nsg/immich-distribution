# Release update

I took a month for this release due an unusable buggy `1.125` release with six patch releases. The database layer has been swapped out in the upstream project and with a large change like this I was in no hurry to update. I also have a lot of personal things going on, so it fit me well to take a month of while it settled down a little.

I will release `1.126` directly to stable in a few days assuming I see no issues in my testing.
