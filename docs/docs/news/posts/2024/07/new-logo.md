# New Logo

We have a new logo. Immich changed logo earlier this year and I have always felt that my old logo was rushed and more of a placeholder.
The old logo was the outer ring of Immich old logo with a box in the middle reflecting on the fact that Immich Distribution is a package of Immich.

| New | Old |
|-|-|
| ![](/assets/immich-dist.png){width=200px} | ![](/assets/immich-dist-old.png){width=180px} |

I moved "Immich" inside the box in the new logo, it's better reflects what's going on. I also choose to not reuse parts of the new logo due the fact that the new logo is probably trademarked by FUTO. The colored leaves have the same basic shape as the leaves in the new Immich logo. I kept the red theme from the old logo. I feel that this also better reflects that Immich Distribution also contains more things, like databases, extra features and so on.
