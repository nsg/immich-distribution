The documentation site for Immich Distribution has been migrated from [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org). The old site was based on [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which is a fantastic foundation for MkDocs-based sites. However, it was also opinionated and somewhat inflexible. Zola is a fast (really fast) static site generator that I've been using for my personal blog and enjoy, so I moved this site over to gain more flexibility.
