Upstream Immich has this message attached to the release page for Immich 1.113. If you use OAuth with the mobile application you need to update your OAuth provider like below.

> For OAuth users, please replace `app.immich:/` with `app.immich:///oauth-callback` for the Redirect URI in your OAuth provider settings
