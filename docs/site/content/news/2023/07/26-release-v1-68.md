[Issue #53](https://github.com/nsg/immich-distribution/issues/53) - (Released to beta 2023-07-26)

Bumped the version, improved tooling around my [update modal patch](/build/patches/) because it had changed in upstream again. This should make it easier for me to update this in the future if the file changes.

{% admonition(type="info", title="Vaccation") %}
The update was delayed a little due my vacation and the above patch made this a tiny bit more complex.
