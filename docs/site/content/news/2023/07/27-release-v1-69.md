[Issue #55](https://github.com/nsg/immich-distribution/issues/55) - (Released to beta 2023-07-27)

The last release contains improved update tooling, this release contains [improved tests](/build/tests/). This should help me find problems earlier, and shorten the amount of manual testing that I need to do.
