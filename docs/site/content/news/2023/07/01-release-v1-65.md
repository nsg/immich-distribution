[Issue #46](https://github.com/nsg/immich-distribution/issues/46) - (Released to beta 2023-07-09)

{% admonition(type="info") %}
I have done 12 releases :partying_face: of Immich Distribution since I started this project back in March, that's almost 4 months and about 3 releases per week! Updates have gotten easier but I have had a few annoying ones that took me quite a lot of time to figure out. I have also been away for a week and had several releases to catch up with when I got back.
{% end %}

This has been one of these easy releases with just a version bump needed, see the [release notes](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/tag/v1.65.0). I mainly created this post to get started with a news section on the brand new project and documentation site. I hope to publish short release notes with relevant news and changes related to Immich Distribution.

## Changes

* Documentation moved, and expanded, to this site
* Immich v1.65.0
