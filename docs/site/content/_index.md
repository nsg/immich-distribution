# Immich Distribution

![Immich Screenshot](/assets/immich-screenshot-2024.png)

These pages contains documentation related to the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs) package [immich-distribution](https://snapcraft.io/immich-distribution). It's based on [Immich](https://immich.app/), a self hosted [Google Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos) replacement in early development. The package is inspired of the official Immich images. It will be **similar, but not identical** with the official Docker-based installation. Extra tools and customizations are included. This project is **not related to [FUTO](https://futo.org/)** in any way.
