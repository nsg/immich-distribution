# Immich Distribution Documentation

[![immich-distribution](https://snapcraft.io/immich-distribution/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/immich-distribution)

These pages contains documentation related to the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs) package [immich-distribution](https://snapcraft.io/immich-distribution). It's based on [Immich](https://immich.app/), a self hosted [Google Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos) replacement in early development. The package is inspired of the official Immich images. It will be similar, but not identical with the official Docker-based installation. Extra tools and customizations are included.

For more general information about this project see the [GitHub project](https://github.com/nsg/immich-distribution). This is also the place where you can suggest ideas, report bugs and overall keep yourself informed on what's going on with the project.

## Install

```sh
sudo snap install immich-distribution
```

The package can be installed from the snap store like any other snap package. The package is over 500MB in size so it can take a little while to install. See the [installation section](@/installation/install.md) for more information.
