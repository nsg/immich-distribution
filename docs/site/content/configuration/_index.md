# About configuration

By default you should have a working installation of Immich, but you may like to configure it a bit.

Immich Distribution focuses on easy of install, not to be fully configurable so everyting from upstream Immich is not configurable. But feel free to open an issue if you like to have an option added.

Most Immich Settings can be changed under `Administration` in Immich from a user with the appropriate permissions. The documentation provided here are settings that can't be changed from Immich Administration, or changes specific for Immich Distribution.

:material-chat-alert-outline: The configuration options are organized in separate sub pages under this section.
