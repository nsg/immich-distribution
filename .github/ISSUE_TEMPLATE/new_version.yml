        1. Read the [release notes](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases) and figure out if I need to do something.
        2. Run `./update.sh old-tag new-tag` like `./update.sh v1.52.1 v1.53.0` to diff a few select files and make relevant changes.
        3. Read Immich Discord to get a feeling if there is any critical bugs (and maybe wait for a dot release).
        4. Build and test it locally.
        5. Push it to a branch in a PR, let CI run it's tests.
        6. Merge the PR, wait for snapcraft build service to do it's thing and release a build to edge channel.
        7. Promote it to the beta channel and test to.
        8. Promote it to candidate and live with it my self for an appropriate amount of time.
        9. Promote it to stable.
